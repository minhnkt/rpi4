         NOTE: if you install 21.02.0 please change your
               UPGRADEsFLAVOUR="release"
               in order to track stable releases via
               the updatecheck bar




        ##### 21.02.1-11(v3) and r18436 should contain a fix for onboard wifi (21.02.1-3/r17600ish was last known good)


        ##### 21.02.1   rebuild(1.0.10) seems to have probable wifi issues
                        https://forum.openwrt.org/t/enabling-integrated-adapter-usb-wi-fi-adapter-for-raspberry-pi-4-b-simultaneously-does-not-work-after-upgrading-to-latest-current/115300?u=wulfy23

        ##### r18370    occasional micro-hangs not yet seen master likely pretty good now
        ##### r18325ish php7 has been dropped this will probably cause issues for
                        [tty][editor] luci 'extras' or any usercode running php
                        ymmv... the above is non-essential so will release as
                        normal and possibly update or remove those features
                         -### php8-mod-json #NotAvailableWhatsItfor?

                        bootstrap dark|light is not working [new upstream setting]
                        (probably build related - low priority)

                        updatecheck font color is sometimes whacky
                        (low - medium priority)



        ##### fingers crossed regen@20211229>1.0.10 for below... alot of untested wifi stuff
        ##### TBA CVE busybox fixes https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/4815
              @21.02.x only just for yourself afaict risk is medium to low
              near term... 21.02.2 will likely be tagged anyways


        ##### r18161 back to probably r17699 ish may not have functional wifi
        ##### r18270 as above and both need private browsing / incognito to
                     avoid luci login issue
              https://forum.openwrt.org/t/rpi4-community-build/69998/1701?u=wulfy23 r18161/270 network stalls maybe





        ##### 21.02.1_1.0.6-2 is initial and likely subject to minor fixes in the coming
              week/s release users may wish to wait a week or two before upgrading
                   -also there is no huge benefits really some https wolfssl stuff
                   -argon 2.2.9 (probably) (chrome css issue)
                   -really minor luci stuff
        


        ##### ujail and seccomp on master builds
          -around 20211023 master switched to including procd(seccomp+ujail) by
           default... these packages are EXCLUDED from these builds due to
           potential to cause users production issues until a future date...

           typical issues revolve around dnsmasq not starting or file paths



        #####
          -possible wifi anomalies switched to foundation blobs/bin
          -wg3: argon theme(2.2.3-5) > interfaces > peers does not save


        ############################## current AKA 3.5.6x+/r176xx AKA testing(for now) for r17625>r17631>r17637 on test
        ############################## r17674 > stable (nmap still broken)

        NOTE
          -files: xt_geoip samples are now downloaded if used
           (nobody uses I think and they are out of date a little)


        ISSUES(maybe)
          -nmap may be broken [ /usbstick 55Â°] nmap -v
           Error relocating /usr/bin/nmap: _ZSt28__throw_bad_array_new_lengthv: symbol not fo
           (note: zerotier-cli also effected)
           (update appears resolved as of: r18086)


          -wg1 fairly stable unless you run wireguard!!! UNCONFIRMED interface bring up issue
          -wg2: FIXED @sammutd88 (status page seems unavailable) > stull busted

          -possible snmpd issues?
          -FIXEDr17637 waiting for zerotier: update to 1.6.6 update (older builds have minor vuln/if used)
           https://www.zerotier.com/2021/09/21/incident-response-to-september-20th-2021
          -TBA possible statistics quirks (looks ok so far)?

        ############################## zerotier
          -as it seems very inert when disabled... and is generally
           of use particularly on firstboot/remote access when
           cgnat is in play... I am testing adding this service

          -if anyone notices any signs when it's disabled... or
           has ethical concerns please post on the forum

          -there *may* be scope to leverage this for complex
           support requests or debugging also... (for which
           it could be manually installed also by the user)

           stressing IT IS DEFAULT DISABLED (should do NOTHING!)


           afaik the dependant libs (natpmp and upnpc also are inert?/
           cause no conflicts or similar issues)

           *possible scope for this and things like v2raya to be
            bundled into a new 'mega'-ish variant down the track
            if required (some users want it some dont)




        ############################## build_key/s rotation [20210917]
           -users on builds older than ~5months may need
            sysupgrade -R -F /tmp/sys.img.gz


        ############################## r17517+ wolfssl vuln bump ->4.8.1
           -https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases


        ############################## cdn opkg repos act funny
           -have removed the use of cdn for official repos
            on snapshot builds... it was quick and worked
            for several months but it has started acting
            funny...

        ############################## possible issues on 3.5+(kernel 5.10)
           -bgnet eth0 icmpv6 "rare" ethernet driver crashing (has workaround)
           -pppoe firstboot issues > intermittent?
           -probable intermittent asix3.0 dongles
            Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0b95:1790 ASIX Elec. Corp. AX88179


        ############################## ntfs-3g CVE's fixed@3.5.30+
           -https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pull/16506
           -https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/30/1
            build is not patched yet... have not looked at the
            details myself... but as ntfs is not commonly advised
            or used likely low in a build context


        ############################## simple-adblock default lists
           -there is some WIP basic simple-adblock list backup and default
            logic added... users of simple-adblock may experience quirks
            related to this but afaik it shouldn't really effect much
            after the first upgrade (which will carry existing backups
            in the next upgrade)


        ############################## CVE-2021-3711/2
           -all builds rc4+<3.5.5(r17430) and below contain known openssl cve
            make your own determination as to criticality


         ############################# ~3.5.5-16+ undo(payload) since 3.2.100
            -changes made to the AUTORESTORE(packages) logix may be unusual >UNDO



         ######################## kernel 5.10 @ 3.5.x

             NOTE: localfix implemented for 3.5.x builds @ kernel 5.10 ipv6 bug
                   users of ipv6 with connections faster than 300Mb/s may wish
                   to stay on 3.2 builds for now
         

         ######################## gcc10 + k140 + sqm bump @ 3.5.x
         ### r17355+
         ### r17339+ sqm got bumped works ok but stats show larger backlogs?
             statistics more userspace?(better?)




         ####################################################################### ~3.2.130
         -9 https-dns-proxy 90 iface hotplug workaround implemented
         -7 https-dns-proxy 90 iface hotplug needs seperate images after fixed


        looks like I broke auto package restore for a while;
        https://forum.openwrt.org/t/rpi4-community-build-onhold/69998/1225?u=wulfy23
        edit: false alarm... only effects complex firstboot internet peeps or similar




         ####################################################################### ~3.2.107

         Drop snort3 too large and needed more use/testing

         Drop collectd-mod-dns due to issues with ipv6 and (wip) remove
         existing related luci_statistics config

         Add PERFTWEAKS_SCRIPT= for alternate script to run




         #######################################################################


         3.2.100 ROOTFSEXPAND > default adding takes effect on second upgrade


                  -changes made to the AUTORESTORE(packages) logix may be unusual
                   mostly around no restore then restore toggling

                      1: moves /etc/config/opkg if AUTORESTORE is off
                         (apologies if you use vgaetera's script independantly
                          i need to use another name for that file)
                      2: random removal of acme on my system unable to determine
                         the cause as yet... may revert all these changes
                         depending on further fallout

                 UPDATE: may have resolved the above



         3.2.61-63 fix ROOTFSEXPAND (+ fakeinternet + wireguard-helper [testapps])
 
         3.2.61-50+ support ROOTFSEXPAND=1 on upgrade [default-nobackport]

        ############################################################################## 3.1.30ish?

        WWWMODS:            Not wanting to delay the current version any longer
                            3.1.57-23 contains some www features that are not
                            yet parameterized.

                            For the uber-security concious... please use

                             -excludes vl805

                              $> rpi-eeprom-update -a




        POSSIBLEVFATISSUE:  not really confirmed but attempted to use a new usbstick
                            (Product:  SanDisk 3.2Gen1) and df -h would freeze/take
                            a long time with its default filesystem (vfat)
                            Possible false positive as was setting up block mount
                            so may have been double mounted or something

                            OPKGFEEDS_USEHTTP=1 (faster) if enabled

        UPDATENOTICECHANGE: builds after 2.9.17-116 will contain some small changes to the
        (rollingout)        update checking and notification code...

                            anticipate some teething issues with old versions

                            please pm me on the forum or post on the thread if you see odd
                            behavior...

        BACKUPFEATURE:      The backup feature in the above notice makes files available for
                            download at http://IP/backup this may or may not pose some
                            security concerns (typically internal lan related only) depending
                            on your environment... if you use this feature... you can;
                            
                                  click 'refresh' after downloading the file
                            
                            to remove and clear...
                            These files are currently store on /tmp so reboot will also
                            clear...

#WIP BELOW

###########################




           ############################## added nft-qos mostly for mac rate limiting
                                       -> 'adding' maybe...
           (current only is not fully functional@upstream bugs)

           -when I initially looked at this... mac limiting was ok... but
            there were/are bugs with luci for the other tabs...
           -i've now decided that these luci issues are not reason enough
            to hold back adding this package... as the other runtime
            state optimisations are addressable
           -additionally it's sort of handy to have nft around to mess with
            for some transitional stuff

           -be advised... cannot provide support for the actual 'user-level'
            side of this package... but 'os-level' details I happy to
            work with (enabled|disabled|package_fundamental_function_bugs)
           -especially for interested if anyone does NOT use this and
            finds it intrusive/difficult to disable/uninstall via
            packagesremove.txt (hopefully that wont be needed)
            i.e. if it is not in ENABLEDSERVICES then the only
            drawback afaik is the loaded kmods...
            (or at least that's the end goal, if there are any
             performance hits because of this... i'll look more
             at dynamically unloading or removing after first
             boot)
